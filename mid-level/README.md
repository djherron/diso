# Mid-level ontologies

Mid-level ontologies sit between domain-specific ontologies and upper-level ontologies in a conceptual 3-level hierarchy (or pyramid). They serve to connect the specialised concepts of particular domains at the base of the pyramid with the abstract, general concepts at the top of the pyramid.

Mid-level (middle level) ontologies are **bridges** between domain and upper ontologies.
