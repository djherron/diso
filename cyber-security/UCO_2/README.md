## Caution: two ontologies share the name UCO

There is an unfortunate **name clash** between two cyber-security ontologies that have both been named **UCO**. To distinguish between them, DISO refers to them as `UCO_1` and `UCO_2`.

Be careful not to mistake one for the other. They are very different.
