# CVE

## Overview 

**CVE: Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures**

website:
* https://www.cve.org/
* the MITRE corporation created CVE
> Identify, define, and catalog publicly disclosed cybersecurity vulnerabilities

> CVE is sponsored by the U.S. Department of Homeland Security (DHS) *Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency* (CISA)

CVE is not normally available in OWL format. We obtained our copy of the `cve.ttl` file from the SEPSES (Semantic Processing of Security Event Streams) research group at Technical University Vienna (https://sepses.ifs.tuwien.ac.at/) in relation to their **ICS Security KG**. 

The OWL ontology file for CVE that we have obtained for DISO, `cve.ttl`, was created by the SEPSES team. The ontology file itself declares that this is an ontology to **represent CVE**. It also says:
> This ontology is developed based on the NVD resources extracted from NVD (https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/ 
* NVD is the U.S. National Vulnerability Database, managed by NIST: https://nvd.nist.gov/

For safety, DISO users should regard the `cve.ttl` ontology file as an expression of CVE, but not necessarily fully up-to-date with the latest version of CVE.

The DISO `cve.ttl` is one component of the integrated ontology for the SEPSES **ICS Security KG**. See the DISO entry for **ICS-SEC-KG-ONTO** for more information on SEPSES and the **ICS Security KG**, and on the repo from where we obtained the DISO `cve.ttl`.
