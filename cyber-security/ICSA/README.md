# ICSA

## Overview 

**ICSA: Industrial Control Systems Advisory**

We obtained our copy of the ICSA ontology, `icsa.ttl`, file from the SEPSES (Semantic Processing of Security Event Streams) research group at Technical University Vienna (https://sepses.ifs.tuwien.ac.at/) in relation to their **ICS Security KG**. 

The ICSA OWL ontology was created by the SEPSES team. The ontology file declares that it is:
> An ontology to represent ICS Advisory.

It also says:
> This ontology is developed based on the ICSA SCAF v.2  (https://docs.oasis-open.org/csaf/csaf/v2.0/os/csaf-v2.0-os.html) 

CSAF: Common Security Advisory Framework
* an OASIS standard

For safety, DISO users should regard the `icsa.ttl` ontology file as an expression of CSAF common security advisories, but not necessarily fully up-to-date with the latest version of CSAF.

The DISO `icsa.ttl` is one component of the integrated ontology for the SEPSES **ICS Security KG**. See the DISO entry for **ICS-SEC-KG-ONTO** for more information on SEPSES and the **ICS Security KG**, and on the repo from where we obtained the DISO `icsa.ttl`.
