* we acquired the ITIO ontology, `itio.owl`, from here

The technical report entitled `An Insider Threat Indicator Ontology` (Costa, 2016), available from the ITIO website, says:
* work on the ITIO ontology was funded by the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) and the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI)
* it says:
> we also included relevant concepts and definitions from the MITRE Corporation’s **Cyber Observables (CybOX)** and **Structured Threat Information Expression (STIX)** standards

NOTE: DISO has the full STIX 2.1, and it contains CybOX within it
