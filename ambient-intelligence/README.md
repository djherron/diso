# Ambient Intelligence

Per [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ambient_intelligence), **ambient intelligence**:
* Refers to environments with electronic devices that are aware of and can recognize the presence of human beings and adapt accordingly. 
* Its primary purpose is to enhance user interactions through context-aware systems.
* It aims to create environments where devices communicate seamlessly with users, leveraging data from interconnected systems. A common example is the **Internet of things (IoT)**, which integrates everyday devices into networks that provide intelligent responses based on user behavior.

So the notions of **ambient intelligence** and **context-awareness** intersect strongly!
