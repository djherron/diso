# Smart Environments

The DISO contains a number of ontologies that model **environments** of different **scale and scope**. Most of these use the word **smart** in relation to themselves.

From largest to smallest scale/scope, the different categories of **environments** we have encountered are:
* cities
* buildings
* homes

DISO has invented the phrase **smart environments** to act as a general name for this cluster of environment-related ontologies.

Note that the notion of **smart environments** overlaps strongly with the notion of **ambient intelligence**, and hence with **context-awareness**, and thus **situation-awareness**.

The notion of **smart environments** also overlaps strongly with the notion of **digital twins**, and hence with the UK's **National Digital Twin Programme**.
