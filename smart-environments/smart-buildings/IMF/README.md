  - this is where we obtained the IMF ontology file from
  - `imf-ontology.owl.ttl`
  - version 0.3.0 from 20240531

At Jan 2026, this is the latest version of IMF: v0.3.0 (May 2024)

For DISO, we renamed `imf-ontology.owl.ttl` to `imf.ttl`

The Information Modelling Framework (IMF) is and has been in development since the early 2020’s.

According to the IMF Manual (v0.3.0):

The objective of the IMF appears to be modelling **facility assets**

It refers to **"facility assets in the energy industry"** and the need for **"better communication between organisations, people, and IT systems"** because of the increasing complexity of **facility assets**.

It refers to **processes** relating to facility assets and appears to address the **design, construction and operation** processes undertaken in relation to developing and operating large industrial facilities.

It promotes the idea of using **Information Models** "as a way of capturing and expressing information about facility assets", in order to transition to smoother processes for the design, construction and operation of facility assets.

Categorisation of IMF:

Given the content of the IMF Manual and its focus on **facility assets**, with DISO we have place the IMF ontology in the `smart-buildings` cluster of the `smart-environments` cluster. It may not have an explicit `smart` aspect to it, but the **facility assets** it models sound very close to large buildings.
