> The aim of the ontology network mIO! is to represent knowledge related to the context of the user. The context of the user must include the user's local information (position, date), information from the environment (temperature, luminosity), personal tastes of entertainment (theater, sport), and social information (buddy list, agenda). Furthermore, this context should include information about the services that a user can produce and/or consume (availability, price), as well as information on the devices that a user can use (battery, cover).

**mIO!** is network of many component subdomain-specific ontologies that import one another. It may well need merging into a single file.

It's from the Ontology Engineering Group at Univ of Madrid.
