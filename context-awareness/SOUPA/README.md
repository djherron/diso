# SOUPA

**SOUPA** is an ontology that fits in more than one DISO cluster. It currently sits in the DISO `situation-awarenss` cluster because that is where we first assigned it. But it is also clearly about **context awareness** for **pervasive computing**. So it may in fact fit better here in the DISO `context-awareness` cluster. Analysis will tell.

For now, for **SOUPA**, see the DISO `situation-awarenss` cluster.
