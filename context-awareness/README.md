# Context Awareness

**Context awareness** can be regarded as a special case (or subdomain) of **situation awareness**. Based on the set of ontologies gathered in this cluster, **context awareness** has to do with individuals and their immediate surroundings: their environmental context. The common thread (and motivation) shared by the ontologies in this cluster is the idea of **pervasive computing**, where the objective is for **mobile application services** to **adapt dynamically** based on the app user's current context.

**Context awareness** also overlaps with the notion of **Ambient Intelligence**. DISO does not yet contain ontologies that address ambient intelligence directly, but we encountered the notion several times during the ontology search exercise that led to DISO's creation.
