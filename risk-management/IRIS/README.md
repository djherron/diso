> The Risk Core Ontology describes terms, relationships and restrictions common to all aspects of **risk identification and assessment** regardless of the specific engineering application.

paper:
* `IRISPortal - A Semantic Portal for Industrial Risk Cases Management` (Meditskos, 2012)

Based on the title of the paper, the Risk Core Ontology has to with **industrial** risk identification and assessment.

Based on the word 'Core' in the name of the ontology, and on the description on the website, the Risk Core Ontology purports to be a sort **upper-level** ontology for the domain of **risk identification and assessment**.

Given this, it may be worth checking whether the **cyber-security** ontologies on DISO overlap with or map into the IRIS ontology.
