DOLCE 7 consists of about 40 concepts, 100 relations and 80 axioms: it corresponds to a formal model where upper level categories (endurant, perdurant, quality, and abstract) and general relations (part-of, participation, dependence, etc.) are represented in a standard logic language. This ontology has been explicitly developed in order to meet some core cognitive and linguistic features of common sense knowledge.
