> The Unified Foundational Ontology (UFO) was developed by consistently putting together a number of theories originating from areas such as Formal Ontology in philosophy, cognitive science, linguistics and philosophical logics. It comprises a number of micro-theories addressing fundamental conceptual modeling notions. The ontology is divided in three strata dealing with different aspects of reality, namely:

> **UFO-A**: An Ontology of Endurants dealing with aspects of structural conceptual modeling.

> **UFO-B**: An Ontology of Perdurants (Events, Processes) dealing with aspects such as Perdurant Mereology, Temporal Ordering of Perdurants, Object Participation in Perdurants, Causation, Change and the connection between Perdurans and Endurants via Dispositions.

> **UFO-C**: An Ontology of Intentional and Social Entities, which is constructed on top of UFO- A and UFO-B, and which addresses notions such as Beliefs, Desires, Intentions, Goals, Actions, Commitments and Claims, Social Roles and Social Particularized Relational Complexes (Social Relators), among others.
