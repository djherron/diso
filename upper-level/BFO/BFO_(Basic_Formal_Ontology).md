# BFO description - from Wikipedia

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basic_Formal_Ontology
* a top-level ontology developed by *Barry Smith* and his associates for the purposes of promoting interoperability among domain ontologies
* The structure of BFO is based on a *division of entities into two disjoint categories* of *continuant* and *occurrent*, the former consists of objects and spatial regions, the latter contains processes conceived as extended through (or spanning) time. BFO thereby seeks to consolidate both time and space within a single framework.
* BFO has been adopted as a foundational ontology by over 650 ontology projects [9], principally in the areas of *biomedical* ontology, *security and defense* (intelligence) ontology [10], and *industry* ontologies.
* In January 2024, BFO and the *Common Core Ontologies (CCO)*, a suite of BFO-extension ontologies, were adopted as the **"baseline standards for formal DOD and IC ontology" development work in the DOD and Intelligence Community**
  - DOD - U.S. Department of Defense
  - IC - Intelligence Community
