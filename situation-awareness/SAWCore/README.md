# SAWCore

## Overview

**SAWCore: Situation Awareness Core** ontology

paper:
* `A Core Ontology for Situation Awareness`, Matheus, Kokar, and Baclawski, 2003

The SAW core ontology is an **upper-level** ontology for more domain-specific (and detailed) Situation Awareness ontologies. That is, within the broad domain of Situation Awareness, it aims to be subdomain-independent, and relevant to all of them.

Because of its close association with Situation Awareness, DISO does not (yet) regard SAWCore as an upper-level ontology of the likes of BFO, DOLCE, and GFO. Hence, SAWCore has been assigned to the DISO `situation-awareness` cluster rather than the `upper-level` cluster.

We searched hard but were unable to find SAWCore online. Eventually we emailed Dr. Kokar to ask for help. Dr. Kokar responded with kind words and the ontology file we sought.
