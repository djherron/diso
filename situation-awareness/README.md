# Situation Awareness

Per [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Situation_awareness), **Situation Awareness** (SA) is defined in multiple ways, such as:
* the understanding of an environment, its elements, and how it changes with respect to time or other factors
* the perception of the elements in the environment considering time and space, the understanding of their meaning, and the prediction of their status in the near future
* adaptive, externally-directed consciousness focused on acquiring knowledge about a dynamic task environment and directed action within that environment
