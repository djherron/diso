# Digital Twins

DISO does not yet contain ontologies that explicitly target the domain of **digital twins**. But some of the DISO clusters clearly overlap strongly with the notion of **digital twins**. For example, the `smart-environments` cluster of ontologies, which model things like cities, buildings and homes, clearly are very close to the concept of a **digital twin**. Indeed, these undoubtedly are technology enablers of **digital twins**.

## What are digital twins?

Digital twins, as defined by the UK's **National Digital Twin Programme**:
* https://ndtp.co.uk/digital-twin-definition/

A digital twin:
> is a **digital representation of a physical-world entity or environment or a process** that includes a **two-way data flow** into and out of the physical world; (ie to/from the physical thing and its digital twin)

> replicates its physical-world counterpart to a known tolerance, performs without statistical bias, and is **able to predict what the associated physical-world entity would do given a stimulus**; and

> provides a level of **prediction confidence** within specified validation envelope and an associated **assumption set**

The following diagram (a cross between a knowledge graph and a mind-map) describes the UK's National Digital Twin Programme:

It is clear from the NDTP diagram that it is not only DISO `smart-environment` ontologies that have relevance to the concept of **digital twins** and the UK **national digital twin** vision. The **IES** ontology, in the DISO `information-exchange` cluster, plays a key role in enabling the **IMF** (Information Management Framework) component of the **NDTP**.

The diagram also shows that the **IMF** needs its own **top-level** (upper-level) ontology, as well as **mid-level** ontology (the FDM and RDL depected in the diagram). With version 5 of **IES**, released in November 2025, these **IMF-specific** top-level and mid-level ontologies have been delivered.  The **IMF-specific** **top-level** ontology is called `ies-top`; the **mid-level** ontology (corresponding roughly to the FDM/RDL) is called `ies-core`.  See the **IES** entry in DISO cluster `information-exchange` for these ontologies.
