# Digital Twins

DISO does not yet contain ontologies that explicitly target the domain of **digital twins**. But some of the DISO clusters clearly overlap strongly with the notion of **digital twins**. For example, the `smart-environments` cluster of ontologies, which model things like cities, buildings and homes, clearly are very close to the concept of a **digital twin**. Indeed, these undoubtedly are technology enablers of **digital twins**.

## What are digital twins?

Digital twins, as defined by the UK's **National Digital Twin Programme**:
* https://ndtp.co.uk/digital-twin-definition/

A digital twin:
> is a **digital representation of a physical-world entity or environment or a process** that includes a **two-way data flow** into and out of the physical world; (ie to/from the physical thing and its digital twin)
> replicates its physical-world counterpart to a known tolerance, performs without statistical bias, and is **able to predict what the associated physical-world entity would do given a stimulus**; and
> provides a level of **prediction confidence** within specified validation envelope and an associated **assumption set**
