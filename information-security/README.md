# Information Security

**Information Security** (InfoSec) is a discipline focused on protecting information in all its forms --- physical (analog, paper, spoken conversations, ...) as well as digital. InfoSec is built around three core principles known as **the CIA triad: Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability**.

Per [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information_security):
> **Information security (infosec)** is the practice of protecting information by mitigating information risks. It is part of information risk management. It typically involves preventing or reducing the probability of unauthorized or inappropriate access to data or the unlawful use, disclosure, disruption, deletion, corruption, modification, inspection, recording, or devaluation of information.
> Protected information may take any form, e.g., electronic or physical, tangible (e.g., paperwork), or intangible (e.g., knowledge).

Given this definition of **Information Security**, it is appropriate to regard information security as a more general case of **Cyber Security**, which is about information security strictly within the digital domain.

Thus, the ontologies gathered in the DISO subdomains of `information-security` and `cyber-security` should, in theory, have good potential for substantial domain overlap and thus for forming interesting ontology alignment problems.
