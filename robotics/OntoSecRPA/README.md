# OntoSecRPA

## Overview

**OntoSecRPA: Security Ontology for Robotic Process Automation**

**OntoSecRPA** is an example of an ontology that fits well in more than one DISO cluster. Due its focus on the RPA domain, it may well overlap nicely with ontologies in the DISO `robotics` cluster. We store **OntoSecRPA** in the DISO `information-security` cluster simply because this is where it was first assigned.

For **OntoSecRPA**, see `information-security`.
